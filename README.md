# Books-Scraper
A Python script that scrapes book details (title, price, stock) from Books to Scrape, stores the data in a Pandas DataFrame, and exports it to a well-formatted Excel file using OpenPyXL. The script also organizes output into a dedicated folder with date-stamped filenames for easy tracking.
